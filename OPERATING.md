# FoxBox Operating Instructions

## Prior to Event
* Ensure that the batteries are charged on the HT radio and the Arduino controller
* Update the Arduino code
	* Set the CW message to be sent
	* Ensure that the correct melody (if applicable) is set
	* Ensure that the correct delay between transmissions is set
* Load the code onto the Arduino
* Set radio to the correct frequency
* Set radio to the correct power level output
* Set radio to have a time out timer slightly longer than the transmission duration


## At Time of Event
* Turn on radio
* Verify all radio settings that were previously set up
* Turn radio volume knob to mid scale
* Verify antenna connection is secure
* Set the melody switch on the controller to the preferred state
* Set the LED enabled switch on the controller to the preferred state
* Plug in the battery to the controller
* If LEDs are enabled, verify that the LED test is successful

## Start of the Hunt
### Starting with box closed
* Close the fox box
* Chain it to a tree or something, if desired
* From another radio on the same frequency, transmit a DTMF 1 tone
* Ensure that the fox box begins transmitting

### Starting with box open
* Depress the manual beacon start button
* Ensure that the fox box begins transmitting
* Close the fox box
* Chain it to a tree or something, if desired


## End of the Hunt
* If desired, from another radio on the same frequency, transmit a DTMF 0 tone while the fox box is not transmitting to stop the fox's future transmissions.
* Unchain and open the box
* Unplug the battery
* Turn off the radio
* Job done
